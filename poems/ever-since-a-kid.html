Ever Since a Kid
I don't know if it's ADHD or BPD, Or maybe even Autism or PTSD.
I just know I've been fucked up -
Ever since a kid.
I know I just ain't quite been right.
I said I didn't know what it was - And I didn't,
For over half my life.
But now?
Now they tell me l've got all four.
With depression And anxiety
Mixed in.
I always knew I weren't right,
Ever since a kid.
Now they know -
And all they do is prescribe pills.
"Take this one,"
"Wash it down,"
"And you'll be fine,"
They say.
I take that much medication,
I rattle.
The worst part is - They don't help.
The demons, The illnesses, Are all still there. just as alive as ever.
I've been sick for more Than half my life - Probably all my life.
I know l've never been right.
I've always been fucked up,
Ever since a kid.
